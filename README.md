### Motivation 
mr. peabody was bored after his endsem exams. He hadn't performed quite well in them. In fact he screwed up almost everything in the past semester.<br>
Hence, mr. peabody decides to take his mind off from the stress of grades and CPI by doing random things for fun, and thus he decides to learn how to create a to-do-list application.

### The catch!
With the new to-do-list application, mr. peabody now bosses around Sherman, giving him redundant tasks all through the day. Sherman is in a fit of rage now :)
